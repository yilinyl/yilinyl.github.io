My name is Yilin Liu. I am a first-year PhD student in Computational Biology at Cornell University. I received my master's degree in Biostatistics at Yale and bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Southeast University, Nanjing, China. 

<!-- My research interest -->

Outside of academia, I enjoy ballet and watercolor painting.
