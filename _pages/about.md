I am a first-year PhD student in Computational Biology at Cornell University. I reckon myself as a "multidisciplinary" person. I received my master's degree in Biostatistics at Yale and bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Southeast University, Nanjing, China. 

<!-- My research interest -->

Outside of academia, I enjoy ballet and watercolor painting.
